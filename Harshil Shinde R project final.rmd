## **Uber Taxi Data Visualization in R**

## Introduction

Welcome to this hands-on project on Uber Taxi Data Visualization using
R. This project is crafted to enhance understanding of machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and data science through practical application.
Our focus will be on the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset,
providing a rich ground for data exploration and visualization.

## Objective

The core objective of this project is to delve into the Uber Pickups
dataset, utilizing the powerful R libraries for data visualization.
Through this project, we aim to uncover patterns, insights, and trends
within the Uber pickups data, focusing on customer behaviors and pickup
distributions across New York City. This exploration is not just about
learning to visualize data but also about understanding the stories
hidden within it.

The data contains the columns Date.Time which is a factor, Latitude and
Longitudes which are double and Base which is factor. we will format the
datetime into a more readable format using the Date Time conversion
function. To save date and time, we have utilized POSIXct

## Explaination of this bar chart

1.  X-axis - The horizontal axis represents different hours of the day.
    It\'s labeled from 0 to 23, which corresponds to a 24-hour clock
    format, beginning at midnight and ending at 11 PM.
2.  Y - axis - The vertical axis shows the total number of trips, which
    are labeled with numbers that appear to be in the thousands.
3.  Bar characteristics - Each bar represents the total number of trips
    that were recorded for a given hour of the day. The bars are filled
    with a steel blue color and outlined in red, as specified in the
    code.
4.  Data trends
    1.  There is a period during the early hours (midnight to around 5
        AM) where the number of trips is relatively low.
    2.  The number of trips begins to increase starting from the early
        morning hours, peaking in the evening (possibly around 6 PM to 9
        PM). This could indicate rush hour traffic or a popular time for
        people to use the service.
    3.  After the peak, the number of trips declines but remains
        relatively higher than the early morning hours until it dips
        again late at night.

## Explaination of the bar chart

1.  X-axis - This axis represents hours of the day, likely in a 24-hour
    format, going from 0 to 23.
2.  Y-axis - This axis indicates the total number of trips, with the
    scale suggesting a range that extends into hundreds of thousands.
3.  Bar segments - Each bar is segmented into different colors, each of
    which represents data for a particular month from April to
    September, as shown in the legend. The height of each segment within
    a bar corresponds to the number of trips taken during that
    particular hour in that specific month.
4.  This visualization could help in identifying trends over time. For
    instance, if the bars get taller over consecutive months, it
    indicates an increasing trend in the total number of trips.

## Explanation of the graph

1.  X-axis - The horizontal axis is labeled with numbers from 1 to 31,
    indicating the days of the month.
2.  Y-axis - he vertical axis shows the number of trips, and the scale
    is labeled with numbers that go up in increments, which seem to
    indicate tens of thousands of trips.
3.  Bars - Each vertical bar\'s height represents the total number of
    trips taken on that day of the month. The uniform color
    \"steelblue\" is used for all bars, focusing the attention on the
    height differences rather than on differentiating between
    categories.
4.  Insights:
    1.  The bars\' varying heights suggest fluctuations in the number of
        trips from day to day within the month.
    2.  The viewer can identify which days had the highest and lowest
        numbers of trips.
    3.  The chart may be used to observe patterns or anomalies in daily
        trips, such as weekly cycles or days with unusually high or low
        activity.

## Explanation of the graph {#explanation-of-the-graph}

1.  X-axis - The categories along the horizontal axis represent the days
    of the week, from Sunday through Saturday.
2.  Y-axis - The vertical axis quantifies the number of trips, and it
    appears to be in the range of tens of thousands, as indicated by the
    label \"50,000\", \"100,000\".
3.  Bars - Each bar\'s height corresponds to the total number of trips
    for a given day of the week within a particular month. The bars are
    grouped by day, allowing for easy comparison across months.
4.  Colors in the legend - The different colors within each group of
    bars represent different months, with each color corresponding to a
    month as explained in the chart legend. This allows viewers to
    compare the number of trips across different months but on the same
    day of the week.
5.  Insights
    1.  Weekly Patterns: By examining the height of the bars, one can
        determine which days of the week are generally busiest or
        slowest across different months.
    2.  Monthly Patterns: The chart may reveal monthly trends, such as
        whether trips increase or decrease during specific months.
    3.  Day-to-Month Relation: There may be patterns that show certain
        days are consistently busier or quieter across all months, or
        there might be unique patterns within specific months.

## Conclusions

1.  In 1st graph, roughly around 4:30 to 6 pm, the demand of cabs is
    quite high as maybe the working population go back to their home
    after their shifts.
2.  In 2nd graph, if we calculate the total cabs booked in all months,
    around 6pm is the busiest hour.
3.  In 3rd graph, 30th and 11th are the busiest days for Uber as they
    have the highest booking on these days.
4.  In 4th graph, we get to know that the demand of cabs increase
    gradually as the month passes. By this, we can see September on
    every day of the week has highest demand.
